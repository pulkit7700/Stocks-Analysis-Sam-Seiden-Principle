  """
  This function implements the demand and supply principle as presented by Sam Seiden.
  It returns the value at which we can enter the trade.

  Args:
    price: The current price of the asset.
    volume: The volume of trading at the current price.

  Returns:
    The value at which we can enter the trade.
  """

  # Calculate the demand and supply at the current price.
  import math

  demand = volume * math.exp(-price / 100)
  supply = volume * math.exp(price / 100)

  # If demand is greater than supply, then we should enter the trade at the current price.
  if demand > supply:
    return price

  # Otherwise, we should wait for the price to go up before entering the trade.
  else:
    return price + 100
