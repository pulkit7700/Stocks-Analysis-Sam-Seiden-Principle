            "[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  and it made me realize that, you know, we haven't done a session that's purely lesson-based in quite a long time.\n",

            "[01:11.000 --> 01:21.000]  works in any timeframe in any asset class, stocks, futures, Forex, certainly a huge part of options.\n",
            "[01:21.000 --> 01:26.000]  So you can see kind of the title of this session here, Why FX Banks Make Money in New Deal.\n",
            "[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  Now, that's not to suggest that nobody makes money and only banks make money,\n",
            "[01:31.000 --> 01:43.000]  but the reality is it's pretty clear that, you know, I don't think we need to hide it, right?\n",
            "[01:44.000 --> 01:52.000]  Many retail traders, right, like you and I, don't do very well.\n",
            "[01:52.000 --> 01:57.000]  I mean, what's the success rate of an average FX retail trader? Not great.\n",
            "[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  At the same time, you know, big banks and institutions tend to do pretty well,\n",
            "[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  yet both groups are buying and selling in the exact same market. So why is that?\n",
            "[02:07.000 --> 02:15.000]  Why is the gap so wide between, you know, big, consistently profitable banks and, you know,\n",

            "[02:42.000 --> 02:45.000]  but I'm certainly going to give you my best effort here. I can promise you that.\n",
            "[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  Okay. Well, I'm going to explain it all to you here, Ray and Chuck.\n",
            "[02:50.000 --> 02:57.000]  So I started my career not as a trader, not as a retail trader,\n",
            "[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  certainly not as an educator. That came way later.\n",
            "[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  But I started on the institution side of the business, the big bank side of the business.\n",
            "[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  And I also started on the floor of the Chicago Mercatel Exchange, right,\n",

            "[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  as we get into that in a few minutes.\n",
            "[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  So I started on the floor of an exchange working on the institution side of business,\n",
            "[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  not the retail side of business.\n",
            "[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  And I had no experience.\n",
            "[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  And I will tell you, you know, looking back today,\n",
            "[03:37.000 --> 03:40.000]  that was the biggest benefit I could have had.\n",
            "[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  Learning this the right way from the beginning was absolutely key.\n",
            "[03:44.000 --> 03:52.000]  It was critical to, you know, the learning process, learning the right way.\n",
            "[03:52.000 --> 03:59.000]  So I would get down to the floor, and I actually started in the currencies, right?\n",
            "[03:59.000 --> 04:02.000]  CME back then had two floors, currencies on one floor\n",
            "[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  and pretty much everything else on another.\n",
            "[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  So I get down to the floor about an hour before the markets get going.\n",
            "[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's kind of what the trading floor looked like right there.\n",
            "[04:12.000 --> 04:18.000]  And I would be taking orders from banks, institutions, money managers, hedge funds, you name it.\n",
            "[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  Big orders, right?\n",
            "[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  Limit orders, buy and sell orders.\n",
            "[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  You didn't have the euro back then.\n",
            "[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  You had the Deutschmark and all the others, right?\n",
            "[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  Pounds, yen, everything.\n",
            "[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  And about, I'd say, 10, 15 minutes is what a market would really get going.\n",
            "[04:33.000 --> 04:34.000]  You stop answering the phones.\n",
            "[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  You stop taking these orders because you have all this big mess of unorganized paper in front of you.\n",
            "[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  So you create stacks of orders, piles of orders, all according to price.\n",
            "[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  Put the buy orders to my left.\n",
            "[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  And let me just get you to this.\n",
            "[04:50.000 --> 04:55.000]  Put the buy orders to my left and the sell orders to my right, and off we would go.\n",
            "[04:55.000 --> 05:01.000]  Now, one thing I didn't need anybody to tell me is how and why prices turned in a market\n",
            "[05:01.000 --> 05:03.000]  and where prices would turn in a market.\n",
            "[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000]  I can tell you that and be right almost always.\n",
            "[05:06.000 --> 05:07.000]  Why?\n",
            "[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  Because I had some of the biggest orders in the world in front of me, right?\n",
            "[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  And I had Morgan Stanley over directly to my right and other big banks and institutions all around me.\n",
            "[05:16.000 --> 05:19.000]  And everybody had very similar orders.\n",
            "[05:19.000 --> 05:25.000]  For example, if I wanted to know where the Japanese yen was going to stop falling and turn higher,\n",
            "[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  I'd look down and to my left and find the largest stack of buy orders below current price.\n",
            "[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  That was the market's real demand, just like this.\n",
            "[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  If I wanted to know where the market was going to stop rallying and turn lower,\n",
            "[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  I'd look down to my right and find the largest stack of sell orders above current price.\n",
            "[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  That was the market's real supply.\n",
            "[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  And all prices would do every day just like they do today.\n",
            "[05:47.000 --> 05:55.000]  They go from demand to supply and back again until all the orders in that stack of orders are filled\n",
            "[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  and price quickly shoots to the next stack of orders.\n",
            "[05:58.000 --> 05:59.000]  That's all that happened back then.\n",
            "[05:59.000 --> 06:00.000]  That's all that happened today.\n",
            "[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  That's how it's always worked.\n",
            "[06:02.000 --> 06:05.000]  And that's how it always will work, pure supply and demand in the market.\n",
            "[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  Now, as I'm saying this, you may be thinking today the bids and offers, you know,\n",
            "[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  supply and demand, it's very easy to see for screen-based traders.\n",
            "[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  You may be thinking because you see it in the form of bids and offers on your trading screens.\n",
            "[06:19.000 --> 06:22.000]  Let me make sure you understand that's not what I'm talking about.\n",
            "[06:22.000 --> 06:27.000]  I would argue those bids and offers that you see on your screen are not exactly real.\n",
            "[06:27.000 --> 06:28.000]  How do I know that?\n",
            "[06:28.000 --> 06:33.000]  First of all, how many times a day do you see the bid like 10 times the size of the offer\n",
            "[06:33.000 --> 06:39.000]  and prices fall or the offer like 10 times the size bid and prices rally?\n",
            "[06:39.000 --> 06:40.000]  That happens all the time.\n",
            "[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  Stocks, futures, FX for sure.\n",
            "[06:43.000 --> 06:45.000]  How could that happen if those numbers are real?\n",
            "[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  Well, that information is not exactly real.\n",
            "[06:49.000 --> 06:51.000]  Are those numbers there and are those numbers real?\n",
            "[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  Yeah.\n",
            "[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  But are the intentions real?\n",
            "[06:54.000 --> 06:55.000]  No.\n",
            "[06:55.000 --> 06:59.000]  Now, how do I know that the orders that I was dealing with on the floor of the exchange were real,\n",
            "[06:59.000 --> 07:02.000]  these orders that I'm showing you here, real demand and real supply?\n",
            "[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  First of all, it was completely illegal for me to trade my own account, number one.\n",
            "[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  Number two, there's cameras pointed at you from every direction.\n",
            "[07:12.000 --> 07:14.000]  That's worse than a casino.\n",
            "[07:14.000 --> 07:19.000]  The phone lines are recorded.\n",
            "[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  You hear the beep every few minutes and on and on and on.\n",
            "[07:22.000 --> 07:29.000]  My point is why was there so much security and scrutiny around what I was doing?\n",
            "[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  After all, I was just a phone clerk at the time.\n",
            "[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  It wasn't like I was making millions of dollars.\n",
            "[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  There was just so much security around what I was doing.\n",
            "[07:37.000 --> 07:43.000]  It's because what I had access to was the market's real willing buyers and real willing sellers\n",
            "[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  and the biggest in the world, right?\n",
            "[07:46.000 --> 07:50.000]  Some of the biggest buy and sell orders in those markets were right in front of me at my fingertips.\n",
            "[07:50.000 --> 07:55.000]  And my question to you is, if you have access to that information,\n",
            "[07:55.000 --> 08:00.000]  where banks are really buying and where banks are really selling, do you need anything else?\n",
            "[08:00.000 --> 08:05.000]  Is there anything else you need in your decision-making process or any other tool you need?\n",
            "[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  No, exactly, I agree.\n",
            "[08:07.000 --> 08:16.000]  So that and that alone is the focus of our lesson today and that's at the heart of our strategy.\n",
            "[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  Today we don't see paper orders, right?\n",
            "[08:22.000 --> 08:27.000]  And certainly screen-based bids and offers not only don't show us what we need to see,\n",
            "[08:27.000 --> 08:31.000]  most of the time they show us the opposite of what we need to see.\n",
            "[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  So how do we make sense of all this?\n",
            "[08:33.000 --> 08:37.000]  Understand the whole supply-demand 101 concept.\n",
            "[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  When we look at a chart, it's that same picture just sideways, okay?\n",
            "[08:43.000 --> 08:46.000]  We're going to get pretty deep into strategy.\n",
            "[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  Don't worry about that, but when we look at a chart, okay, it's the same.\n",
            "[08:50.000 --> 08:56.000]  You have to be able to see the same supply-demand concept, only it's sideways, all right?\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 09:03.000]  Now, I want to expose you to some pretty important information here,\n",
            "[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  some things you have to wrap your head around in order to get this.\n",
            "[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  These orders that I'm showing you on the right side of the screen, right,\n",
            "[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  are these filled orders or unfilled orders, the supply-demand, the stacks of orders here?\n",
            "[09:24.000 --> 09:26.000]  Have those trades happened yet?\n",
            "[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  They're unfilled, correct, okay?\n",
            "[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  Those are unfilled orders.\n",
            "[09:31.000 --> 09:36.000]  Now, understand that the only thing that causes prices to turn in a market\n",
            "[09:36.000 --> 09:39.000]  and move in a market are unfilled orders.\n",
            "[09:39.000 --> 09:41.000]  Would we all agree with that?\n",
            "[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  Does everybody agree that the only thing that causes prices to turn and move in markets\n",
            "[09:45.000 --> 09:47.000]  are unfilled orders?\n",
            "[09:47.000 --> 09:49.000]  Anybody disagree with that?\n",
            "[09:49.000 --> 09:51.000]  I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\n",
            "[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  Right, we all agree.\n",
            "[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  Here's the problem, okay?\n",
            "[09:57.000 --> 10:03.000]  The chart, what does the chart show us, filled orders or unfilled orders?\n",
            "[10:03.000 --> 10:09.000]  The price chart shows us filled orders, whether you're looking at a candlestick chart,\n",
            "[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  you know, line chart, bar chart, point and figure chart, volume,\n",
            "[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  any kind of chart you can possibly come up with on every platform out there,\n",
            "[10:17.000 --> 10:21.000]  they show you filled orders, okay?\n",
            "[10:21.000 --> 10:24.000]  Not only are we, you know, not looking at fulfilled orders,\n",
            "[10:24.000 --> 10:26.000]  but we're looking at the opposite of that.\n",
            "[10:26.000 --> 10:32.000]  Does everybody kind of see that, you know, so again, when you think about the concept of,\n",
            "[10:32.000 --> 10:38.000]  you know, why are individual retail traders so bad at this\n",
            "[10:38.000 --> 10:40.000]  and why are banks so good at this,\n",
            "[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  it's hard to see why the gap is so wide.\n",
            "[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  All banks are looking at are unfilled orders.\n",
            "[10:46.000 --> 10:49.000]  Retail traders looking at the opposite.\n",
            "[10:49.000 --> 10:51.000]  That's a pretty big advantage.\n",
            "[10:51.000 --> 10:52.000]  Does that make sense?\n",
            "[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  There's other reasons why the gap is so wide, but that's a big one.\n",
            "[10:56.000 --> 11:05.000]  So now the good news is you can do a pretty good job of identifying key unfilled orders\n",
            "[11:05.000 --> 11:09.000]  on a price chart if you know what you're looking for.\n",
            "[11:09.000 --> 11:10.000]  We'll move on in a second.\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  Your eye, okay, when you're looking at a chart, your eyes are going to see, you know,\n",
            "[11:16.000 --> 11:18.000]  candles or bars or whatever you're looking at.\n",
            "[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  Your eyes are going to see this, what you're looking at on the screen here.\n",
            "[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  But when your eyes see this, your brain needs to process this.\n",
            "[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  Does that make sense?\n",
            "[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  Now, this little concept we just talked about here, again,\n",
            "[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  it's not in trading books or anything, but it's very important for you to understand that.\n",
            "[11:36.000 --> 11:41.000]  Most traders that just, you know, live on trading books and webinars and stuff,\n",
            "[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  they're never going to come close to realizing that basic concept,\n",
            "[11:45.000 --> 11:47.000]  but it's a pretty big thing.\n",
            "[11:47.000 --> 11:51.000]  So we need to be able to look at a price chart that shows us filled orders\n",
            "[11:51.000 --> 11:53.000]  and figure out where the unfilled orders are.\n",
            "[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  You know, here's a trade we took a while back in the Japanese yen,\n",
            "[11:56.000 --> 11:59.000]  just identifying a price level we're supplied to,\n",
            "[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  to the man where banks were selling, and we sold there too.\n",
            "[12:02.000 --> 12:08.000]  But let's back up here and go over this concept.\n",
            "[12:08.000 --> 12:13.000]  So we need to be able to see the two groups on a price chart, okay?\n",
            "[12:13.000 --> 12:17.000]  Banks and institutions and retail traders.\n",
            "[12:17.000 --> 12:19.000]  They both have very different footprints.\n",
            "[12:19.000 --> 12:23.000]  You need to be able to identify the difference in those footprints.\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  Let's do that.\n",
            "[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  So in the short period of time we have together today,\n",
            "[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  I figured, I thought the two things I could cover that will help you\n",
            "[12:34.000 --> 12:39.000]  at least start to really help you understand this market timing concept\n",
            "[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  are right here, and we're going to dive into the chart in a second.\n",
            "[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  Number one, we're going to start to learn how to identify those key supply\n",
            "[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  and demand levels, specifically where banks and institutions are buying\n",
            "[12:48.000 --> 12:50.000]  and selling in the market.\n",
            "[12:50.000 --> 12:55.000]  And number two, we're going to learn to identify the footprints of banks\n",
            "[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  and the footprints of retail traders,\n",
            "[12:57.000 --> 13:02.000]  because you need to understand who is on the other side of your trade, okay?\n",
            "[13:02.000 --> 13:04.000]  You need to understand that.\n",
            "[13:04.000 --> 13:07.000]  You need to, you know, wouldn't it be nice to know if, say,\n",
            "[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  a Goldman Sachs or a Barclays Bank or a big bank is on the other side\n",
            "[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  of your trade versus maybe a novice retail trader?\n",
            "[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Wouldn't it be nice to know that?\n",
            "[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  Well, we could do a pretty good job of getting there.\n",
            "[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  So let's begin, and let's start with step number one.\n",
            "[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  Give me one second here.\n",
            "[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  I just want to adjust this cord here.\n",
            "[13:27.000 --> 13:28.000]  It's giving me a little problem.\n",
            "[13:28.000 --> 13:33.000]  Hang on, one second.\n",
            "[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  Can you guys hear?\n",
            "[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  Okay, great.\n",
            "[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  Hopefully that's a little better.\n",
            "[13:42.000 --> 13:43.000]  So let's start with step number one.\n",
            "[13:43.000 --> 13:46.000]  Let's start to learn how to identify these supply and demand levels.\n",
            "[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  We can do a pretty good job of quantifying how much supply\n",
            "[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  and demand is there also with the odds enhancement.\n",
            "[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  So we'll have a little time to get into that today as well.\n",
            "[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  All right, look at the chart right here where I'm pointing.\n",
            "[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  I know there's probably a little lag in the connection\n",
            "[14:03.000 --> 14:08.000]  and pointing everything, so I'll take it nice and slow.\n",
            "[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Price is trading sideways here.\n",
            "[14:09.000 --> 14:13.000]  Supply and demand appears to be in balance, right?\n",
            "[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  While price is moving sideways in this base up here that's labeled supply,\n",
            "[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  we don't know its supply yet.\n",
            "[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  I don't know if price is going to rally out of that level,\n",
            "[14:21.000 --> 14:24.000]  decline out of that level, and I really don't care.\n",
            "[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  Actually, we can come close to figuring it out,\n",
            "[14:27.000 --> 14:30.000]  but that's not what we're going to be talking about today.\n",
            "[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  So just hear me out.\n",
            "[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  So price is trading sideways, right?\n",
            "[14:32.000 --> 14:35.000]  Supply and demand appears to be in balance.\n",
            "[14:35.000 --> 14:38.000]  All of a sudden, however, there's a decline in price.\n",
            "[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  Make sure you understand we are not trying to predict this decline in price.\n",
            "[14:42.000 --> 14:45.000]  We're not trying to make money on this decline in price.\n",
            "[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  We let this happen, right?\n",
            "[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  We don't know that this is going to happen until after it happens.\n",
            "[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  So sit back, nice and relaxed, and let this happen.\n",
            "[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Once prices do decline, however,\n",
            "[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  that gives us very objective information for this level up here,\n",
            "[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  which is now a level.\n",
            "[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  Understand that the only reason why price is going to decline from this level\n",
            "[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  is because objectively supply exceeds demand up here.\n",
            "[15:08.000 --> 15:11.000]  There's a supply and demand imbalance.\n",
            "[15:11.000 --> 15:15.000]  Yeah, we'll get to that, Shane, with the odds enhancers.\n",
            "[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  So once prices drop out of this level,\n",
            "[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  this becomes a supply level, okay?\n",
            "[15:20.000 --> 15:22.000]  Based on a very specific set of rules,\n",
            "[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  we wrap two lines around this level and vary this level forward,\n",
            "[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  bringing the supply zone or sell zone.\n",
            "[15:27.000 --> 15:30.000]  We want to know where the sellers are.\n",
            "[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  Down at the bottom, just the opposite is true.\n",
            "[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  Price is trading sideways.\n",
            "[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  All of a sudden, there's a strong rally in place.\n",
            "[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  Once this rally happens, that's when we could say, aha,\n",
            "[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  we now know where the real willing buyers are at this market.\n",
            "[15:43.000 --> 15:47.000]  Where objectively demand exceeds supply.\n",
            "[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  Again, based on a very specific set of rules,\n",
            "[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  we wrap two lines around this level, carry this level forward,\n",
            "[15:52.000 --> 15:54.000]  creating that demand zone or buy zone.\n",
            "[15:54.000 --> 16:00.000]  We want to remember where the buyers are, okay?\n",
            "[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  Another work for supply, retail prices.\n",
            "[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  Another work for demand, wholesale prices.\n",
            "[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  Let's move on.\n",
            "[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  Just a side note, anything we don't finish today,\n",
            "[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  we'll go over next time.\n",
            "[16:16.000 --> 16:18.000]  All right.\n"

            "Okay. Welcome. So normally, for quite a while now, we get on and we go over the live charts,\n",
            "and we set up trades, and we'll do those trades, and take trades, and all that,\n",
            "all based off of our core strategy, market timing strategy.\n",
            "But over the past couple months, I've had more and more questions come in,\n",
            "and it made me realize that, you know, we haven't done a session that's purely lesson-based in quite a long time.\n",

            "We'll certainly focus on FX today, but just understand that everything we're going to talk about\n",
            "works in any timeframe in any asset class, stocks, futures, Forex, certainly a huge part of options.\n",

            "I mean, what's the success rate of an average FX retail trader? Not great.\n",
            "At the same time, you know, big banks and institutions tend to do pretty well,\n",

            "Okay. Well, I'm going to explain it all to you here, Ray and Chuck.\n",

            "as we get into that in a few minutes.\n",
            "So I started on the floor of an exchange working on the institution side of business,\n",
            "not the retail side of business.\n",
            "And I had no experience.\n",
            "And I will tell you, you know, looking back today,\n",
            "that was the biggest benefit I could have had.\n",
            "Learning this the right way from the beginning was absolutely key.\n",
            "It was critical to, you know, the learning process, learning the right way.\n",
            "So I would get down to the floor, and I actually started in the currencies, right?\n",
            "CME back then had two floors, currencies on one floor\n",
            "and pretty much everything else on another.\n",
            "So I get down to the floor about an hour before the markets get going.\n",
            "That's kind of what the trading floor looked like right there.\n",
            "And I would be taking orders from banks, institutions, money managers, hedge funds, you name it.\n",
            "Big orders, right?\n",
            "Limit orders, buy and sell orders.\n",
            "You didn't have the euro back then.\n",
            "You had the Deutschmark and all the others, right?\n",
            "Pounds, yen, everything.\n",
            "And about, I'd say, 10, 15 minutes is what a market would really get going.\n",
            "You stop answering the phones.\n",
            "You stop taking these orders because you have all this big mess of unorganized paper in front of you.\n",
            "So you create stacks of orders, piles of orders, all according to price.\n",
            "Put the buy orders to my left.\n",
            "And let me just get you to this.\n",
            "Put the buy orders to my left and the sell orders to my right, and off we would go.\n",
            "Now, one thing I didn't need anybody to tell me is how and why prices turned in a market\n",
            "and where prices would turn in a market.\n",
            "I can tell you that and be right almost always.\n",
            "Why?\n",
            "Because I had some of the biggest orders in the world in front of me, right?\n",
            "And I had Morgan Stanley over directly to my right and other big banks and institutions all around me.\n",
            "And everybody had very similar orders.\n",
            "For example, if I wanted to know where the Japanese yen was going to stop falling and turn higher,\n",
            "I'd look down and to my left and find the largest stack of buy orders below current price.\n",
            "That was the market's real demand, just like this.\n",
            "If I wanted to know where the market was going to stop rallying and turn lower,\n",
            "I'd look down to my right and find the largest stack of sell orders above current price.\n",
            "That was the market's real supply.\n",
            "And all prices would do every day just like they do today.\n",
            "They go from demand to supply and back again until all the orders in that stack of orders are filled\n",
            "and price quickly shoots to the next stack of orders.\n",
            "That's all that happened back then.\n",
            "That's all that happened today.\n",
            "That's how it's always worked.\n",
            "And that's how it always will work, pure supply and demand in the market.\n",
            "Now, as I'm saying this, you may be thinking today the bids and offers, you know,\n",
            "supply and demand, it's very easy to see for screen-based traders.\n",
            "You may be thinking because you see it in the form of bids and offers on your trading screens.\n",
            "Let me make sure you understand that's not what I'm talking about.\n",
            "I would argue those bids and offers that you see on your screen are not exactly real.\n",
            "How do I know that?\n",
            "First of all, how many times a day do you see the bid like 10 times the size of the offer\n",
            "and prices fall or the offer like 10 times the size bid and prices rally?\n",
            "That happens all the time.\n",
            "Stocks, futures, FX for sure.\n",
            "How could that happen if those numbers are real?\n",
            "Well, that information is not exactly real.\n",
            "Are those numbers there and are those numbers real?\n",
            "Yeah.\n",
            "But are the intentions real?\n",
            "No.\n",
            "Now, how do I know that the orders that I was dealing with on the floor of the exchange were real,\n",
            "these orders that I'm showing you here, real demand and real supply?\n",
            "First of all, it was completely illegal for me to trade my own account, number one.\n",
            "Number two, there's cameras pointed at you from every direction.\n",
            "That's worse than a casino.\n",
            "The phone lines are recorded.\n",
            "You hear the beep every few minutes and on and on and on.\n",
            "My point is why was there so much security and scrutiny around what I was doing?\n",
            "After all, I was just a phone clerk at the time.\n",
            "It wasn't like I was making millions of dollars.\n",
            "There was just so much security around what I was doing.\n",
            "It's because what I had access to was the market's real willing buyers and real willing sellers\n",
            "and the biggest in the world, right?\n",
            "Some of the biggest buy and sell orders in those markets were right in front of me at my fingertips.\n",
            "And my question to you is, if you have access to that information,\n",
            "where banks are really buying and where banks are really selling, do you need anything else?\n",
            "Is there anything else you need in your decision-making process or any other tool you need?\n",
            "No, exactly, I agree.\n",
            "So that and that alone is the focus of our lesson today and that's at the heart of our strategy.\n",
            "Today we don't see paper orders, right?\n",
            "And certainly screen-based bids and offers not only don't show us what we need to see,\n",
            "most of the time they show us the opposite of what we need to see.\n",
            "So how do we make sense of all this?\n",
            "Understand the whole supply-demand 101 concept.\n",
            "When we look at a chart, it's that same picture just sideways, okay?\n",
            "We're going to get pretty deep into strategy.\n",
            "Don't worry about that, but when we look at a chart, okay, it's the same.\n",
            "You have to be able to see the same supply-demand concept, only it's sideways, all right?\n",
            "Now, I want to expose you to some pretty important information here,\n",
            "some things you have to wrap your head around in order to get this.\n",
            "These orders that I'm showing you on the right side of the screen, right,\n",
            "are these filled orders or unfilled orders, the supply-demand, the stacks of orders here?\n",
            "Have those trades happened yet?\n",
            "They're unfilled, correct, okay?\n",
            "Those are unfilled orders.\n",
            "Now, understand that the only thing that causes prices to turn in a market\n",
            "and move in a market are unfilled orders.\n",
            "Would we all agree with that?\n",
            "Does everybody agree that the only thing that causes prices to turn and move in markets\n",
            "are unfilled orders?\n",
            "Anybody disagree with that?\n",
            "I just want to make sure we're all on the same page.\n",
            "Right, we all agree.\n",
            "Here's the problem, okay?\n",
            "The chart, what does the chart show us, filled orders or unfilled orders?\n",
            "The price chart shows us filled orders, whether you're looking at a candlestick chart,\n",
            "you know, line chart, bar chart, point and figure chart, volume,\n",
            "any kind of chart you can possibly come up with on every platform out there,\n",
            "they show you filled orders, okay?\n",
            "Not only are we, you know, not looking at fulfilled orders,\n",
            "but we're looking at the opposite of that.\n",
            "Does everybody kind of see that, you know, so again, when you think about the concept of,\n",
            "you know, why are individual retail traders so bad at this\n",
            "and why are banks so good at this,\n",
            "it's hard to see why the gap is so wide.\n",
            "All banks are looking at are unfilled orders.\n",
            "Retail traders looking at the opposite.\n",
            "That's a pretty big advantage.\n",
            "Does that make sense?\n",
            "There's other reasons why the gap is so wide, but that's a big one.\n",
            "So now the good news is you can do a pretty good job of identifying key unfilled orders\n",
